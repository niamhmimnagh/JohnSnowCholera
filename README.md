# README

This repository contains a selection of shapefiles which can be used to re-create John Snow's famous map of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London, Soho. 
The jpeg used to create the tif file was downloaded from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak (accessed 14 November 2024). 


Files included: 
Snow_cholera_map: tif file created in QGIS, warped through georeferencing
cholera_cases: 317 points for each location where one or more deaths occurred by cholera. Contains information about the number of deaths that occurred in each case 'Count', and the and the angle at which the bar should be rotated in order to fully reproduce the original map, 'Angle' (necessary for graphical representation only).
pump_locations: 13 points for the location of water pumps.
